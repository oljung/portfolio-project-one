                    There are a number of nations and organizations all competing for power and influence. 
                    Some are large and sprawling nations, other secret orders or crime syndicates operating in the shadows. 
                    Because of this, conflicts and wars are common enough to offer opportunity for those prepared to take the risk, 
                    or breed desire for vengeance in those who have suffered.

                <h2>Ravalon (The Empire)</h2>
                <p>
                    The dominant force in the area. Originally a number of smaller, 
                    feudal nations who joined together in an alliance to counter the invading undead hordes of Kez. 
                    After the war this alliance formed an empire under the dynasty of Tybalt. 
                    Through the years Ravalonâ€™s relations with its neighbors worsened, 
                    as the empire was constantly hungry for new territories. 
                    When the high elves withdrew to Isva Alari Ravalon field the vacuum of power that emerged. 
                    Ravalon is ruled by an emperor who relies a lot on the church of Aton (the main god of Ravalon) and its Stormbringers. 
                    There are many that argue that the church is the true power in Ravalon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the emperor dies a new emperor is selected by the nobles and the church. 
                    If no candidate can gain a majority vote the current emperor's heir will ascend the throne. 
                    They must be formally elected, but it is common practice that the heir is elected unless there are any obstacles. 
                    There have been numerous dynasties on the throne of Ravalon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current emperor, Tybalt VII, is old and has no heir. 
                    The nobles and the church have already started to maneuver, 
                    but no obvious successor has appeared and many claim that when the emperor dies, chaos will erupt.

                <h2>Isva Alarai</h2>
                <p>
                    Isva Alari is the homeland of the high elves. They used to act as the protectors of the world,
                    and their realm once covered nearly the entire world. Several brutal conflicts reduced their population dramatically, 
                    and as elves reproduce rather slowly it became clear that they were headed for extinction. 
                    About 3-400 years ago they withdrew to Isva Alari and severed all contact with the rest of the world. 
                    The triggering factor was that the relations with Ravalon soured. 
                    Some claim that the elves are planning to reclaim their lost realm and put mankind in its place, 
                    others mean that they are even weaker than previously thought and that they are trying to hide how broken they really are out of fear of extinction.

                <h2>Independent nations </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the Empire now controls most of the continent, there are still some nations and groups that have remained independed from the Empire.
                    Two of the more important of therse are the Free Islands and the Northern Tribes.
                </p>
                <h3>The Free Islands</h3>
                <p>
                    A name used for the islands to the west of Ravalon that are self-governing. 
                    Their main source of income is trade and fishing, and in some part piracy. 
                    Garbuka, one of the islands, is an infamous pirate nest controlled by the Krakenâ€™s Tendrils, the eight mightiest pirates. 
                    The members of this council sit on their chairs until someone else claims it in a bloody manner.
                </p>
                <h3>The Northern Tribes</h3>
                <p>
                    North of the empire, close to the cold abyss, you find the home of the warlike northern tribes. 
                    After losing territories to Ravalon a few decades ago they have become somewhat pacified, as they were overrun by the Stormbringers and the emerald enclave. 
                    The new generation of warriors however harbour plans to bring the tribes back to their former glory.

                    A collection of cities under the mountains to the east of Ravalon. 
                    They are connected by tunnels that run underground, which in places are also connected to the underdark. 
                    Due to this connection they often fight both drow and duergar to reclaim their ancient halls deep under the mountains. 
                    All cities have their own king, but there is a high king who has his seat in Valgrum, the largest of the dwarven cities.

                    The kingdom mostly exists as ruins buried under the desert sand, and those who try to explore them often encounter undead monsters. 
                    On the opposite side of the desert there is a city that appears to have survived, but stands empty. 
                    No one who has entered the nameless cityâ€™s walls have ever returned.
