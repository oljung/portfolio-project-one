                <h2>Races</h2>
                <p>
                    The peoples of Iateria number many different races, 
                    sometimes so different from one another that it is hard to see them all as humanoids. 
                    Their genetic, social and cultural differences will not seldom lead to conflict. 
                    By and large however many of them coexist with but minor frictions. 
                    Some races are considered civilized members of the empire or surrounding nations, 
                    while others are considered monstrous and evil by nature. Such races will be attacked on sight most of the time when near a settlement of other races. 
                    There are significantly more races than those presented here, but these are some or the more common or significant.

                <h2>Humans</h2>
                <p>
                    The most numerous of the races of Iateria. 
                    Originally the humans formed primitive tribes, 
                    but their ambitious nature quickly saw them form organized kingdoms that eventually led to the downfall of the elves' golden age. 
                    Humans live short lives compared to elves and dwarves, maturing around the age of 15 and usually dying of old age between 60 and 70. 
                    It is not that uncommon to see humans reach the 80’s but most don’t expect to live that long. 
                    They are often viewed as erratic and impulsive by the races with longer lifespans, 
                    those races often regarding humans as upstart children. 
                    Their adaptability and prolific nature has contributed to the spread of humans to every corner of the world and their rise to dominance.

            <div class="text-content left-side">
                <h2>Elves</h2>
                <p>
                    Elves are a noble race of slender build who live, compared to humans, extraordinarily long lives. 
                    It is not uncommon for an elf to reach their 8th century. 
                    Elves are, for instance, considered children for at least their first century alive. 
                    This may explain why elves struggle to take many humans seriously who part with this world from old age when an elf would still be in his childhood years. 
                    During their lifetime an elf will reproduce but a few times. This in turn means that a generation lost to war will take centuries, 
                    if not millennia to repair. After the rise of human kingdoms and empires the high elves secluded themselves to preserve their race and save it from extinction. 
                    There are three main types of elves, the high elves, the wood elves and the drow (dark elves).
                </p>
                <h3>High Elves</h3>
                <p>
                    High elves are the pinnacle of civilization and knowledge, 
                    their long lifespans enabling them to gather immense knowledge and reach a cultural development unseen anywhere else. 
                    The mystical land of Isva Alari is said to be beautiful beyond imagining, though few if no other race has ever set foot there. 
                    High elves are not uncommon in the empire, where they often hold respectable positions in society.
                </p>
                <h3>Wood Elves</h3>
                <p>
                    East of Ravalon, beyond the dwarves’ mountains, lies the Lyadelle woods. 
                    There was once the ancient realm of the wood elves, now long gone and but a memory in the oldest of the remaining wood elves. 
                    The wood elves still present live in fractured tribes who lead nomadic lives in the far reaches of the woodlands. 
                    There are quite a few wood elves in the empire where they act as upright citizens.
                </p>
                <h3>Drow</h3>
                <p>
                    The dark elves are a hated race among most of the surface dwelling races. 
                    Following the great betrayal, where the goddess Llolth betrayed the other gods, the drow took to the underdark. 
                    There, in the dark tunnels and caves they worship their evil mistress through their matriarch, the matron mother. 
                    She, with the help of her priestesses, controls the drow population and directs the surface raids to capture more slaves to toil away endlessly in their deep, dark mines.
                </p>
                <h3>Half-elves</h3>
                <p>
                    As many elves now live in human societies as citizens of their nations, the union of man and elf is not uncommon. 
                    The resulting offspring of such a union is a half-elf, a combination of the features of both races. 
                    While they don’t live nearly as long as an elf, they live considerably longer lives than humans. 
                    As they stand out to both elves and man, they are often seen as humans among elves, and as elves among humans, making it hard for them to truly fit in. 
                    They are however respected by both human and elf alike, and suffer little to no discrimination.

            <div class="text-content right-side">
                <h2>Dwarves</h2>
                <p>
                    The dwarves are an industrious race of short, stout and stubborn individuals. 
                    The lifespan of a dwarf is long, not seldom reaching up to 500 years. 
                    Settlements and kingdoms that to humans only exist in history and myth therefore live vividly in the memory of the oldest dwarves. 
                    They make their homes deep within the mountains, where other races are rarely allowed to enter. 
                    The exception to this is the city of Kar Boldor, which acts as the dwarves' gate to the rest of the world. 
                    Each city has their own king, and most of the cities are connected through tunnels. 
                    Some of these tunnels have decayed and are now connected to the underdark, forcing the dwarves to constantly fight drow and duergar for their right to exist.
                </p>
                <h3>Duergar</h3>
                <p>
                    The grey dwarves, known as duergar, are a vicious cousin to the dwarves. 
                    They live in the underdark, building vast cities in the dark caves and tunnels. 
                    Evil by nature and vicious of temper they are hated on the surface should they ever emerge from their dark caves. 
                    Whenever a dwarf and duergar meet, it is bound to end in violence as the two races cannot stand the presence of the other.

                <h2>Orcs</h2>
                <p>
                    Orcs are brutish and savage by nature. 
                    What they lack in brains they make up for in brawn, and orcs are often used as meaty battering rams in monstrous armies or serving evil organisations as muscle. 
                    They are viewed as monsters by civilization and are unwelcome near settlements, be they human, elvish or dwarvish. 
                    Orcs from primitive tribes or rowing bands of raiders and instill fear in remote settlers where raids for slaves and food are common.
                </p>
                <h3>Half-orcs</h3>
                <p>
                    Significantly less common than half-elves, half-orcs may be the result of an orcish raid to a human settlement, 
                    or the intentional mating of vicious humans with orcs. 
                    The resulting offspring is less savage and ferocious than an orc, but significantly less calm and poised than a human. 
                    They do however inherit some of the human’s rationality, and this combined with the brute strength of an orc they make a rather formidable fighter. 
                    Half-orcs are tolerated in most settlements, but viewed with scepticism and suffer from a fair deal of discrimination.
