                <h2>The Continent</h2>
                <p>
                    The main part of Iateria consists of the massive empire Ravalon, 
                    covering most of the eastern continent. To the south of the empire the massive Kishkan desert begins, 
                    an inhospitable dry wasteland. To the north the cold abyss, 
                    with it’s eternal winter has made the lands similarly inhabitable. 
                    The eastern part of the empire borders the dwarven kingdoms and their halls under the mountains. 
                    To the west “The Savage Waters” serves as a natural border. Kadessa, the mighty capital of Ravalon,
                    is located in the central parts of the empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In The Savage Waters the Free Islands have become a hub for trade and enjoy a high level of autonomy. 
                    It is not uncommon for people on the western coast of Ravalon to seek the freedom and adventurous life on board a merchant ship or fishing vessel. 
                    Further west, across the vast ocean, the Emerald wildland with their dense djungle stands as a constant lure for travellers and explorers. 
                    Not much of the continent has been explored by the empire, and stories of new discoveries and wondrous beasts continue to reach the empire, 
                    further enticing new adventurers.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the ages, many empires and kingdoms have come and gone in Iateria. 
                    Although much of the knowledge of those times is now lost, 
                    scholars of different ages have been able to determine certain facts about the history of the magical world of Iateria.
                </p>
                <h3>The primordial age</h3>
                <p>
                    Who created the world, and how it looked in the earlier stages of its existence is something the scholars are still debating. 
                    What they agree on is that it was once a place of elemental chaos, 
                    a constantly storming sphere of primordial forces that eventually formed a globe of mostly oceans. 
                    The first life to appear did so in the deep oceans, and not until countless years passed did landmasses start to appear. 
                    Gradually the gods filled these landmasses with their creations.
                </p>
                <h3>The age of dragons</h3>
                <p>
                    Before elves, humans and the others races appeared the world was dominated by giants and dragons. 
                    The giants built enormous cities at the bottom of the ocean, in the mountains and even among the clouds. 
                    Where the dragons originated from is unclear, 
                    what is certain however is that their sudden arrival sparked a conflict of such proportions that the results of said conflict are visible on the surface of Iateria to this very day. 
                    The conflict left the two races weakened and near extinction, 
                    traces of the giants’ civilizations can still be found near the edges of the world, often secluded, 
                    and what dragons remain are scattered and operate alone. However, when they chance upon civilization the consequences are often catastrophic.
                </p>
                <h3>The age of elves</h3>
                <p>
                    The elves are the only people old enough to remember the age of dragons. 
                    As the titanic was ebbing out they began to take a larger role in the world, 
                    wandering far across the surface of Iateria. This was their golden age, a time of long peace. 
                    Eventually other civilizations formed, they came into contact with dwarves with whom they had good relations and humans, 
                    who by now lived in the primitive tribes that would eventually form the first human kingdoms. 
                    Several bloody wars marked the end of their age, the largest was the betrayal that led to the birth of the dark elves, 
                    the drow. Gradually the high elves began losing their realm and their power.
                </p>
                <h3>The Rise and Fall of Great Kez</h3>
                <p>
                    The first great human kingdom that emerged was Kez, in what is now known as the Kishkan Desert. 
                    Kez was ruled by a council that consisted of several kings and queens, 
                    who all ruled as regent over their own realm. Kez stood for thousands of years, 
                    during the last of which it went through an important change. Their gods were changed and the ruling elite started to perform dark magic practices, 
                    including human sacrifice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No one really knows what caused the downfall of Kex, but in a single moment, 
                    in a cataclysm of enormous proportions nearly the entire kingdom was wiped out, 
                    and its once fertile land was now a deadly desert. A few scattered survivors started to mix with the far more primitive human tribes. 
                    The most distinct shard that remains of Kez is Qis Island, where people still practise many of the traditions of Kez, 
                    although much of the history is lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several hundred years after its downfall the people of Kez rose from the sands of Kishkan, 
                    an enormous undead army led by the ancient kings and queens of Kez, 
                    its sole purpose to plunge the world into darkness. To answer this threat a mighty alliance of elves, 
                    dwarves and men formed, along with a plethora of other races, formed. 
                    The humans of the alliance were led by a man named Tybalt, the chosen one of a god called Aton, a god no one had heard of before. 
                    Under his banners they successfully defeated the undead horde. 
                    After this victory the human alliance formed the empire of Ravalon, with Tybalt as emperor and Aton the protective god.
                </p>
                <h3>The Imperial Age</h3>
                <p>
                    It is now the year 833, as the imperial calendar would have it. 
                    The empire has grown to become the dominant force in the area, be it without any true allies left beyond its borders. 
                    Throughout the years they have found different reasons to claim and annex territories from their neighbors.

                    Deep under the surface of the world lies the underdark, 
                    a vast and sprawling world of tunnels and caves in which the races of the dark have made their homes. 
                    Hosting large cities of drow (dark elves), duergar (grey dwarves) and svirfneblin (deep gnomes) the underdark is home to countless people. 
                    Furthermore the tunnels and caves are crawling with all manner of monstrosities that can easily turn a mining operation into a death trap. 
                    Staying mainly in their dark caves and halls the people of the underdark are rarely seen on the surface and when they do they are met with suspicion. 
                    The peoples of the underdark are sworn enemies of the dwarves and gnomes.

                <h2>Magic</h2>
                <p>
                    Iateria is a land where magic is common enough that everyone knows about it, although not everyone has seen it in practice. 
                    There are several ways a person can obtain magical abilities. 
                    Some are born with it or have it develop within them following a traumatic incident. Others, like druids, obtain it from a deep connection to nature. 
                    Some , like clerics or paladins, will gain magical abilities from devoting themselves to a god while others, 
                    like wizards, by devoting themselves to studies. There are even those, such as warlocks, who will make pacts with powerful beings to gain the ability to wield magic. 
                    Divided into different schools of magic, the effects of spells can range from healing a wound or healing a disease, 
                    raising the dead or calling down fire or lightning from the sky as well as altering the laws of gravity or even time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Magic is mainly controlled by the empire through an organization called the Emerald Enclave. 
                    All professional use must be authorized by the enclave unless you belong to one of the temples.
