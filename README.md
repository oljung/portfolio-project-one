# Iateria Wiki

The Iateria wiki will let you, the lucky user, explore an intuitive and informative website containing all the information needed to learn all you need to know about Iateria, a fantasy world created for players to engage in using the Dungeons and Dragons 5e ruleset. 

The site will contain useful information about the continent of Iateria, the various people that live there and the countries and factions they have formed. You will also learn about the magic that is abundant throughout the world of Iateria.

The Iateria Wiki will be useful for players about to engage in a role playing adventure set in the world of Iateria, for dungeon masters looking for inspiration for at plot or for experienced players of the world wanting to read up on a concept or place of interest they encounter when exploring the wonderous locations of Iateria.

## Features

This wiki consists of a landing page, with basic information about what Iateria is, and what the user can explore further in the site.

### Existing features

As the project moves along development, completed features will be listed here.

### Features left to implement (near future)

Here a list of all features to be implemented

- __Subsection navigation bar__
    - This feature will be a "hamburger" icon used to navigate the subsections of a information page.

These pages will all follow the same format and structure, making information easy to find and making them feel intuitive. The page about dwarves will be stuctured the same as the page for orcs, for instance.

    - This feature will greet the user with an image explaining the purpose of the site, as well as what to expect on it.

    - This feature is the first of the main parts of the site and contains information about the continent and its history.

    - This feature requires tech outside of the scope for this project

## Testing

- __nav bar__

    - The navbar was positioned correctly from the first test, however it became clear that more space was needed between each link. The styling went as intended, with the default styling removed and color and font of the site applied. The active page was given a background color and different text color, and after testing I decided to add some padding to the active class, making the background color cover some area around the text as well. The same style was then applied to the hover pseudo class, which also had its font increased in size to make the link "pop out" when hovered over.

- __Landing page__

    - After som issues with hero image and finding one that fit both feeling of the page and was large enough, I decided on crumbled pages to give it an "old document" feeling. The covertext proved a bit troublesome, requiring multible adjustments and refeshes using dev tools before the text was aligned according to my wishes and spaced out in the box. The box itself was rather troublesome to place, as I wanted it centered. I found a solution on stack overflow, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1776915/how-can-i-center-an-absolutely-positioned-element-in-a-div), which helped alot. It is the "Responsive Solution" post that helped.
