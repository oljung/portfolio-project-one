# Iateria Wiki

The Iateria wiki will let you, the lucky user, explore an intuitive and informative website containing all the information needed to learn all you need to know about Iateria, a fantasy world created for players to engage in using the Dungeons and Dragons 5e ruleset. 

The site will contain useful information about the continent of Iateria, the various people that live there and the countries and factions they have formed. You will also learn about the magic that is abundant throughout the world of Iateria.

The Iateria Wiki will be useful for players about to engage in a role playing adventure set in the world of Iateria, for dungeon masters looking for inspiration for at plot or for experienced players of the world wanting to read up on a concept or place of interest they encounter when exploring the wonderous locations of Iateria.

The site was built as a part of a Diploma in software development, held by Code Institute and is in English for the pupose of assessment and mentoring. The site may be translated in to Swedish at a later date, as many in the target audience are Swedish.

## 1. User Experience

### 1.1 Project introduction

The website is designed to be used by a game master who created his own fantasy role playing game setting. The site will provide a platform for that person to share information about the setting in an ordered and organized way. The site will also aim to inspire others to try out the game or to take up the reins as a game master (dungeon master).

### 1.2 Design guidelines

The user visiting this site will likely have an idea of what role playing games are, and what to expect. As this is a fantasy setting, a color scheme was selected to represent a fantasy themed feeling, using green/grey shades and off-whites and yellow to represent old and faded documents. The site aims to inspire as well as inform, so images to represent the content are chosen to bring life to the content.

### 1.3 Project goals

- Provide the user with information about the fantsy setting in an order and structured manner

- Inspire users to explore the setting in a role playing game

- Provide information on further reading about Dungeons and Dragons, the game the setting is written for

### 1.4 Target audience

The main audience for the site are players of the game who are already in contact with the game master and need a site with all information about the game setting in one place for easy acces. The site is also suitable for other game masters who want a setting for their own campaigns, or inspiration for creating their own setting. Users new to the game may find the site inspiring and wanting to try out playing the game, so information about the game itself should be available through link. The two major categories of users are:

- Players in one of the game masters games<br>
Will visit the site for information about specific part of the setting. This user will want to stay up to date with any changed/added content.<br>
**Needs:** A menu that is intuitive and easy to navigate, with information organized in a structured and logical way. A way to get notifications about changes.<br>
**Goal:** Have information structured in a way that makes it easy for the user to find, and provide menues to subsections. Have some sort of notification of changes to content.<br>
**How:** Organize page content logically, so that topics can be found intuitively on each page. Design menues that are easy to use and clearly directs user to subesctions as well. To solve the ability to stay up to date with changes, a sign up form for newsletter will be provided

- Game masters looking for a setting<br>
Will want information about what to find on the page, giving them a grasp on how much content the setting has and then an easy way to navigate.<br>
**Needs:** A landing page giving a short information about what the site is about and what to find on the site, and good navigation.<br>
**Goal:** Use landing page to give the user quick inforamtion about what to find on the page.<br>
**How:** Design landing page to provide a short information about the page centered to draw attention to it.

### 1.6 Design

- Color scheme
    - The main color scheme is "dark slate grey" (#2F4F4F) and old lace (#FFF7EB) with a darker version of dark slate grey (#1F3333) and an orange color (#F28F3B) for variation. The background of the body (container margin) was given navajo white to keep to the theme of yellowy whites for the "old document" feeling.

- Typography
    - For the body text EB Garamond was used, as distinct and easy to read font. For the headers Nanum Gothic was chosen as it goes well with EB Garamond and has thinner but still distinct letters. A letter specing was used for headers to give them slightly more weight.

- Images
    - For the landing page an image of tattered and torn documents gives the feeling of old and ancient, to go with the fantasy theme. The other images on the site is there to make the user associate with both warriors and magicians, both common in fantasy.
    - Images for the pages are chosen to go with the topic of the text, and all major sections of the page has at least one image connected to it to bring life to the topic.

- Wireframes
    - Open this [pdf](assets/pdf/wireframe.pdf) to view the wireframes. Some changes were then made in the project, to improve readability and cohesiveness of the site.

## 4. Testing

### 4.1 Developmen process
This section vill detail how each part of the site was implemented and tested during development to give an insight to have the site took form. A summary of testing can be found further down.

- __Nav bar__

    The navbar was positioned correctly from the first test, however it became clear that more space was needed between each link. The styling went as intended, with the default styling removed and color and font of the site applied. The active page was given a background color and different text color, and after testing I decided to add some padding to the active class, making the background color cover some area around the text as well. The same style was then applied to the hover pseudo class, which also had its font increased in size to make the link "pop out" when hovered over.

    The entire header is fixed in position. This proved problematic at first, as it would not display apart from on different places of the site. the solution, apart from placing it in the correct position and fixing position, was to adjust z-index to 1. placing it in front of all other elements.

    When adapting the nav bar to smaller screens, I followed a tutorial by [Mark Caron](https://medium.com/@heyoka/responsive-pure-css-off-canvas-hamburger-menu-aebc8d11d793) to create a collapsable menu using only css elements. This code was then adapted to fit the sites layout and coloring. This led to significant testing to find out what part of the css changed what part of the menu. After some toubleshooting, quite a bit of bugfixing due to spelling mistakes, I was able to adapt the menu to fit my intentions. All in all this testing process took about 45 minutes, which compared to other parts of the testing and bugfixing is rather significant.

    The same method used for main menu collapsable for smaller screens was used for subsection menu as well. The code then again had to be adapted to suite the new menu, classes renamed and the css-code changed. This resulted in some testing and bugfixing but the experience of the main menu helped and it was over all a success.

    At the very end of the project, when running the validators I noticed that the subsetion menu were at the wrong side of the screen. It took me a while to find what rule put it on the left side. It was the .sub-menu-burger rule of left:10; that placed it there. Removing that rule put it in the correct place.

- __Landing page__

    After som issues with hero image and finding one that fit both feeling of the page and was large enough, I decided on crumbled pages to give it an "old document" feeling. The covertext proved a bit troublesome, requiring multible adjustments and refeshes using dev tools before the text was aligned according to my wishes and spaced out in the box. The box itself was rather troublesome to place, as I wanted it centered. I found a solution on stack overflow, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1776915/how-can-i-center-an-absolutely-positioned-element-in-a-div), which helped alot. It is the "Responsive Solution" post that helped. For the main part of the ladning page, a flex box display was used. I followed a tutorial found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp#justify-content) on w3s and adapted it to suite my needs. Above the 3 part section there is an information about hte site, simply a paragraph with slightly larger font size and a margin to separate it from the hero image. It took some testing to get the flex box to display the way i wanted, for the "justfity-content: space-between; to work i needed to remove the width of the div containing images.

    When replacing placeholder images with the correct once the entire site bugged out. This was solved by tagetting the images and setting their sizes to inherit from parent element, whose size is controlled by the flexbox display. This rendered the images to display correctly down to a size of 1200px where responsive design will take over.

- __Footer__

    The footer was given opposite coloring to the heder, with background of dark slate grey and color of old lace. When links are highlighted they are colored in the background highlight for header links. This part proved to be pretty straight forward with minor tweaking of margins to get everything in a comfortable position. There is room for social media links, should the world of Iateria have social media platforms in the future.

- __Iateria page__

    The implementation of this page was rather straight forward, not presenting too many issues. After consulting with my mentor we decided to change the layout, so that it alternates between text on the left and text on the right. The structure will then be the same for all information pages, sharing the same styling. 

    - Images
        Some issues with sizing, but much was solved when adding the fixed size for main content container, as suggested by mentor.

    - Padding was added to h3 and p elements to create a more clearly distinguished heirarchy on the page and to make it more obvious what text is connected to which header.

- __Races page__

    To implement this page I simply copied the Iateria page and changed all the text/image content. This worked like a charm on the first four sections. The fifth section, an additional section compared to the Iateria page, did not work as intended however. For some reason, this entire section falls outside of the container div, even though the html is clearly inside it. I have yet to find a solution to this problem (2021-07-20) EDIT: Issue solved by adding the rule "overflow: auto;" to the container class (2021-07-21)
    When adding images to the races and factions pages, I noticed that I needed to add a max hight to pictures, as some pictures would otherwise take up to much space of they were "narrow" in their size ratio. In order to keep the ratio of the image intact I also added the object-fit: contain; rule to all iamges.

- __Factions page__

    Implementing the factions page was very straight forward, as most of the bugs that appeared previously were sorted, and no additional issues arose when adding the factions page. The only thing left to do was adjust the menues as they have different lengths, resulting in padding and margin issues. This was easily solved by adding additional classes and target those in the style.css.

- __Subestcion menu__

    - This menu was originally placed in the container and part of the main content, but has been moved to the header to make the page layout more intuitive. It has also been given a smaller size than the main menu, both on large and small screens, to clearly indicate that it is a sub-menu.

- __Responsive design__

    Implementing responsive design proved less troublesome than I orgininally feared. I decided on three different stylings for the landing page, one for sizes larger than 1200px, one for between 1200-800px and one for smaller than 800px. For the information pages only two layouts are needed, as the layout for larger and medium size work the same, with only smaller screens needing a different approach. As the layout is devided left to right on both landing page and information pages, the decision to stack content vertically on smaller screens felt like the most natural approach. In that case just removing any flex display or float left/right and instead centering content sorted display in of itself.

    After meeting with mentor I got a lot of suggestions on how to align the content properly using paddings, and on the information pages padding text relating to different sections to make it clearer what belongs the what. I was also notified of some hierarchy issues on the landing page, sorted using some additional headings.


### 4.1 Validator testing

The HTML was tested using this [validator](https://validator.w3.org/) with no errors or warnings for any of the .html files

- [Index page](assets/images/readme-images/valid-index.png)

- [Iateria page](assets/images/readme-images/valid-iateria.png)

- [Races page](assets/images/readme-images/valid-races.png)

- [Factions page](assets/images/readme-images/valid-factions.png)

- [Sign up page](assets/images/readme-images/valid-signup.png)

The CSS was tested using this [validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) The 9 warnings are all from the part of the hamburger nav bar menues where I followed a tutorial. I decided to keep that code as is, as the code runs ands the nav bar works. When going through the validator code I also noticed that the subsection menu was placed at the wrong side, see nav bar for more info.

### 4.2 Responsiveness and functionality

#### 4.2.1 Responsiveness
The site was tested using responsivechecker.com (see technologies used) for screen sized ranging from 360px to 1900px and was fully functional and responsive on all of them. The only issue found was the the collapsable menues are slightly out of alignment by a few pixels on some of the mobile screen widths.

#### 4.2.2 Browser compability
The site runs euqally satisfactory on Chrome, Firefox, IE, Edge and Safari. 

#### 4.2.3 Contrast testing
- #2F4F4F as background with #FFF7EB as text or reversed passed on all tests with contrast ratio of 8.39
- #1F3333 on #FFF7EB passed all tests with contrast ratio of 12.1.
- #F7AE6E is sometimes used as a background for active or hovered links. It passed all tests.

### 4.3 Unfixed bugs

**FIXED
- Issue with screen scrolling on horizontal axis on some of the smaller screens. I have looked at all the page content to try to find which element that is too wide and causes this issue, but have been unable to find it. it is really bugging me out, pardon the pun, and as of yet the problem is eluding me.<br>
**FIXED
Solution: Adjust width of container div to be somewhat less wide, removing the issue of elements overflowing. The overflow: auto; is still necessary for all elements to fall into the container on pages with alot of content.

- When viewed on a mobile device, all pages leave i thin slice of the body color under the footer. This line does not show up using the inspector on a desktop screen, and I have been unable to find a solution for the problem.
